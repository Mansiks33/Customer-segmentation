# Customer-segmentation
The opportunities to segment are endless and depend mainly on how much customer data you have at your use.
Starting from the basic criteria, like gender, hobby, or age, it goes all the way to things like “time spent of website X” or “time since user opened our app”. 

**There are different methodologies for customer segmentation, and they depend on four types of parameters:** 

**geographic**, 
**demographic**, 
**behavioral**,
**psychological.**  

**Geographic customer segmentation** is very simple, it’s all about the user’s location. This can be implemented in various ways. You can group by country, state, city, or zip code.

**Demographic segmentation** is related to the structure, size, and movements of customers over space and time. Many companies use gender differences to create and market products. Parental status is another important feature. You can obtain data like this from customer surveys.

**Behavioral customer segmentation** is based on past observed behaviors of customers that can be used to predict future actions. For example, brands that customers purchase, or moments when they buy the most. The behavioral aspect of customer segmentation not only tries to understand reasons for purchase but also how those reasons change throughout the year.

**Psychological segmentation** of customers generally deals with things like personality traits, attitudes, or beliefs. This data is obtained using customer surveys, and it can be used to gauge customer sentiment.

**Machine learning algorithm that’s suitable for customer segmentation problems is the k-means clustering algorithm.**

**Why would you implement machine learning for customer segmentation?
1. More time
2. Ease of retraining
3. Better scaling
4. Higher accuracy

**Exploring customer dataset and its features**
1. Customer ID
2. Products Purchased
3. Complaints
4. Money Spent 

**Implementing K-means clustering in Python**
K-Means clustering is an efficient machine learning algorithm to solve data clustering problems. It’s an unsupervised algorithm that’s quite suitable for solving customer segmentation problems. Before we move on, let’s quickly explore two key concepts

**Unsupervised Learning**
Unsupervised machine learning is quite different from supervised machine learning. It’s a special kind of machine learning algorithm that discovers patterns in the dataset from unlabelled data. 

Unsupervised machine learning algorithms can group data points based on similar attributes in the dataset. One of the main types of unsupervised models is clustering models.
